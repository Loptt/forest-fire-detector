# Forest Fire Detector

The main code is located at image_analysis.ipynb. The code is divided into 4 sections as follows:
* The analysis of a single image
* The analysis of multiple image for the training and test data sets.
* The preprocessing of a single image
* A function to perform the preprocessing in a single step.

The data set is too large to be uploaded to Github. Please download the data from [here](https://essexuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hr17576_essex_ac_uk/EplQh6rwA8pJhHP0jKfg6-kBVHyb1BE9TCAj4MVR0tyOEA).
Once downloaded, it must be placed in a directory called data/ at the root of the project.

Please note that running the Jupyter Notebook with all the data set might take a while to execute (maybe a couple of hours or more...). So please use less data when possible for testing purposes.
